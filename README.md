#### Fibonacci-style
Each term is sum of two preceding terms:
- 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ? (Answer: 34)

## 📊 Scoring System

- **Correct Answer**: +1 point
- **Incorrect Answer**: -1 point
- **Unanswered**: 0 points

Score is only shown at the end to prevent test-taking anxiety.

## 🏷️ Error Classification

The application automatically categorizes common mistakes:

| Error Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| off-by-one | Answer is one unit away from correct | 23 instead of 24 |
| decimal-place | Decimal point is misplaced | 12.3 instead of 1.23 |
| fraction-reduction | Errors in fraction operations | 5/8 instead of 3/4 |
| wrong-ratio | Incorrect ratio in geometric sequences | 486 instead of 162 |
| interleave-swap | Confusing patterns in alternating sequences | Applying wrong rule |
| fib-near | Near-correct Fibonacci calculations | 33 instead of 34 |

## 📈 CSV Export Format

Export your results for detailed analysis:

```csv
question,A,B,C,D,E,correct,chosen,correctness,time_spent,error_tag
"12.34 + 45.67 = ?","58.01","58.02","58.03","58.04","58.05","A","A","Correct","",""
```

Fields:
- `question`: The question prompt
- `A,B,C,D,E`: All answer options
- `correct`: Correct answer letter
- `chosen`: Your selected answer
- `correctness`: Correct/Incorrect/Unanswered
- `time_spent`: Time per question (future feature)
- `error_tag`: Automatic error classification

## 📚 Study Plan Recommendations

### Daily Practice
- Complete one short run of each mode (numeric and sequence)
- Track your score, time remaining, and most frequent error types

### Weekly Focus
- Identify your top error type from the review screen
- Complete 3 re-drill sessions focusing on mistakes (~10 minutes each)

### Micro-techniques
- **Decimals**: Multiply as integers, then place decimal point based on total places
- **Fractions**: Remember a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c and reduce early using GCD
- **Percentages**: Memorize common fraction equivalents (12.5% = 1/8, 6.25% = 1/16)
- **Sequences**: State the pattern before answering; if uncertain, skip and return

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Deterministic Sessions
Use seeds to create reproducible test sessions:
```bash
python main.py --seed 12345
```
This ensures the same questions, order, and options every time - perfect for comparing performance or creating practice tests.

### Practice Mode
Turn on Practice Mode to:
- Remove time pressure
- See elapsed time instead of countdown
- Focus on accuracy and understanding

### Re-drill Mode
After completing a test, use "Re-drill my mistakes" to:
- Practice only questions you got wrong or skipped
- Focus on your weak areas
- Build confidence with targeted practice

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, and presentation
- **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new question types and modes
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code with proper documentation

### Key Components

#### Data Models (`src/models/`)
- `Question`: Represents a single question with metadata
- `TestResult`: Stores test results and statistics
- `Timer`: Handles countdown and elapsed time functionality

#### Question Generators (`src/generators/`)
- `NumericQuestionFactory`: Generates arithmetic problems
- `SequenceQuestionFactory`: Generates pattern recognition problems

#### GUI Components (`src/gui/`)
- `MainMenu`: Main menu with options and settings
- `TestScreen`: Test interface with centered questions
- `ResultsScreen`: Results display and export options
- `ReviewScreen`: Detailed answer review with explanations

#### Test Modes (`src/modes/`)
- `BaseMode`: Abstract base class for test modes
- `NumericTestMode`: Numeric test configuration
- `SequenceTestMode`: Sequence test configuration

#### Utilities (`src/utils/`)
- Currently no external utilities required - all functionality built-in

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tkinter Not Found
If you get an error about Tkinter not being found:
- **macOS**: Install Python from python.org (includes Tkinter)
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **Windows**: Tkinter is included with Python installations

#### Window Not Appearing
- Check that the script is running without errors
- Try running from command line instead of double-clicking
- Ensure virtual environment is activated

#### Performance Issues
- The application is optimized for standard test sizes
- Timer precision is 1-second intervals, suitable for test timing

### Getting Help
- Check the console for error messages
- Ensure Python 3.14.0 is being used
- Run the self-test: `python main.py --selftest`
- Verify uv environment is activated and dependencies installed

## 🤝 Contributing

The application is designed to be easily extensible:

### Adding New Question Types
1. Create a new generator class in `src/generators/`
2. Inherit from `QuestionGenerator`
3. Implement the `generate_question()` method
4. Add to appropriate test mode

### Adding New Test Modes
1. Create a new mode class in `src/modes/`
2. Inherit from `BaseMode`
3. Implement required abstract methods
4. Add to main application menu

### Development Guidelines
1. Maintain the modular architecture
2. Use proper type hints and documentation
3. Follow the existing class hierarchy
4. Preserve deterministic behavior with seeds
5. Test with the `--selftest` flag
